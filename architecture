linearAlgebra -
	includes no customs.
	Purpose - this contains the vectors and matrices and associated maths.
	data types - vec2,vec3,vec4,matrix2x2,matrix3x3,matrix4x4.
	functions - vecx(+,-,*,dot,cross(only for vec3), matrixx(+,-,*)
Geometry -
	includes linearAlgebra
	Purpose - this contains the data types and associated maths for the representation of 2D and 3D geometry. 
	data types - Point, Vector, BarycentricCoordinate(BC), Ray, LineSegment, AABB, Sphere, Plane, Triangle, Mesh, VoronoiRegion, tMatrix, Quaternion.
	functions - GeometryType + Vector = GeometryType(translated). BC * (Point, Point, Point) = Point, Vector by axis = Quaternion.

BoundingVolumes -
	includes Geometry
	purpose - this library is for the various structures associated with bounding volumes used for culling.
	data types - AABB, OBB, BoundSphere, static Octree, dynamic Octree.
	functions - Create{AABB,OBB,BoundSphere}(Mesh,triangle,sphere,Point[]).

Collision - 
	includes Geometry
	Purpose this contains the functions associated for detecting collisions between Geometry and BoundingVolumes.
	functions - tests for different types.
