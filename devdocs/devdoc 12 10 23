I came up with a briliant plan! The purpose of me doing this develop some multi-lingualism in programming. I don't know how easy it would be to make the complex code generated unit tests in the other languages. and in mixal for example, I don't think it is even possible. lies. everything is possible, but I don't want to do code generation in assembly, as it sounds very difficult.

What I'm going to do is create a unit test code generation script in python and then make language plug-ins. This way I can leave the dealings with JSON to python which does it very well. And while I'm programming the same basic things in these libraries, they are still abstracted from each other a bit. Since I'm trying to be idiomatic in the way I program the libraries, they won't necessisarily be programmed in the same way. The unit tests are going to be programmed very tightly due to the nature them being almost identical.
