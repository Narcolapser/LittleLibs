so I'm thinking I might need to change how I have things setup in this repository. I'm thinking I'll break things up into smaller files where things are assocaited with their respective purposes. like inheiritance.

So, for my collision library I need the geometry and math that underlies it. The geometry needs the linear algebra that underlies it and associated math. Break down of files should help me keep things clearer than they are right now.
