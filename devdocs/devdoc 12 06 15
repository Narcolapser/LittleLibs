I'm making another small change to the unit test json. For better readability of the unit test out puts, I'm adding "phases" and "names" to each phase and test.

Everything is falling into place. But now I've got the joy of having to create tons and tons of unit tests. for each data type there are 3 sets of unit tests. the common case, the edge cases, and the beyond the edge cases. That is a lot of unit tests to tackle. TT_TT I'm going to ask reddit what it thinks is a good way to come up with unit tests.
